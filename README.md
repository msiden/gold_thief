# Gold Thief
A platform puzzle game based on the 1984 C64 classic Gilligan's Gold (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cunOhhLYR50)

Gold Thief is written in Python 3.7 using the PyGame (1.9.6) library

#### Installation
* Clone or download the project
* Make sure you have Python 3.7+ and PyGame 1.9.6 installed on your machine
* Open a command prompt and type: python gold_thief.py
* Gold Thief was developed on Windows 10. I imagine it should work well on Mac and Linux too but no promises. 
 
#### Game play
Your family's gold mines have been seized by an evil mining conglomerate through a hostile take over. 
Your objective is to steal back all the gold by collecting it sack by sack from the mines and delivering it to the 
waiting truck while avoiding getting caught by one of the evil miners.

Control the player as follows:  
**UP/DOWN/LEFT/RIGHT:** Steer the player  
**CTRL/ALT/SPACE/ALTGR:** Pick up or drop a gold sack or a wheelbarrow

Hint! Miners don't much like getting hit in the head with a gold sack ;)

Gold Thief is still under development and is missing some features from the original game.
